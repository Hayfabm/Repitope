\title{Preprocess peptide feature dataframes for machine learning.}
\usage{
Features_Preprocess(featureDFList, metadataDFList,
  preprocessedDFList_reference = NULL, coreN = parallel::detectCores())
}
\arguments{
\item{featureDFList}{A list of feature dataframes generated by \code{Features}.}

\item{metadataDFList}{A list of metadata dataframes labeled as "Peptide", "Immunogenicity", and "Cluster". No extra metadata is allowed. Feature dataframes are downsized based on the "Peptide" column in this metadata. In other words, peptides not contained in the metadata dataframe are omitted.}

\item{preprocessedDFList_reference}{A list of feature dataframes generated by \code{Features_Preprocess} for reference. Set \code{NULL} to omit.}

\item{coreN}{The number of cores to be used for parallelization. Set \code{NULL} to skip parallelization.}
