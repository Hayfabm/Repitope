\title{Repertoire-wide TCR-peptide contact profile (rTPCP) analysis with a fixed window size}
\usage{
rTPCP.fixedWindow(peptList, rept = NULL, wind = 4,
  aa.index.id = "MIYS990106")
}
\arguments{
\item{peptList}{A character vector containing input peptide sequences.}

\item{rept}{A character vector containing input TCR CDR3 sequences. A default is NULL; in this case, a reference CD8 TCR repertoire used in the original paper will be used. Alternatively, users can provide a character vector containing a CDR3 sequence repertoire of interest.}

\item{wind}{A size of the window.}

\item{aa.index.id}{A character vector of AAIndex names to be used. Can also be NULL or "all"; in those cases, all AAIndex scales will be used.}
